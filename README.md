# Multi-Language Hate/Non-Hate Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based application for classifying hate and non-hate content in text across multiple languages. The current model supports **English** and **French** for hate/non-hate classification, and **Hindi** for multi-parameter classification.

## Features

- **English-French Hate/Non-Hate Classification**: A sequential model for detecting hate speech in both English and French text.
- **Hindi Multi-Parameter Model**: A multi-parameter classification model for detecting various categories in Hindi text.
- **Streamlit Interface**: A simple user interface using Streamlit to interact with the models and display results.

## Streamlit Interface

Hereâ€™s a preview of the current Streamlit interface where users can interact with the model and see the results:
